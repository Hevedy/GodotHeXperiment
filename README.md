# GodotHeXperiment 
New techs workbench 


Setup:  
 
1.) In Blender create a collection to be your mesh group, and name it after the name of your mesh. 
2.) Inside it add up 4 different meshes and add the suffix "_LODx" where x is the number from 0 to 3. 
3.) Export the group/collection as glTF 2.0 and import it to godot. 
4.) The root of the group must have as parent the script MeshLOD_GD. 
5.) Add in the scene a new LODManager_GD node to manage them all at runtime. 
6.) Profit.
